					This is probably the most famous film by Hayao Miyazaki. It represents the story of ten-year old Tihiro, who were travelling with her parents to a new house and found a whole hidden world, full of mysteries and adventures. The film contains numerous allusions to Japanese pantheistic mythology. Miyazaki's artistic talent has made every cadre breathing with magic. It allows any adult person to become a child once again.

					One of the later films of Hayao Miyazaki can be considered as a tribute to his family (Miyazaki's father was a director of airplane company). It is also a strong anti-war film, that opposes brigtness and poetry of early aviation to the ugliness of aircraft deathbringers which have emerged later. It also emphasizes the theme of family, love and loyalty, which are
					considered to be central in Miyazaki's artistic career.

				<div class="p3">
					The dark epic story of Princess Mononoke rises the theme of interaction between human and environment. This film shows a fierce battle between unstoppable consumable growth of humanity and the ancient spirits of the nature. As it often presents in Miyazaki's films, burning issues of the present-day are wrapped in the form of traditional pantheistic myths. If there is such genre as 'adult' animation films, Princess Mononoke is certainly one of them.
