		<p class="p1">Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo City, Empire of Japan, the second of four sons. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born 1915), was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his brother's company, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II. The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life. Miyazaki has noted that some of his earliest memories are of "bombed-out cities". Several times Miyazaki's family moved from one city to another because of the bombings. This left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, then aged four. As a child, Miyazaki suffered from digestive problems, and was told that he would not live beyond 20, making him feel like an outcast.</p>
		<p class="p1">Miyazaki expressed early interest in animation. When he was 17, his interest was sparkled by Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958), Japan's first feature-length animated film in color. During his years in Gakushuin university, he often drew manga. He never completed any stories, but accumulated thousands of pages of the beginnings of stories. Although he graduated from university with degrees in political science and economics, he immediately started to work for an animation company.</p>
		<p class="p1"> Between 1963 and 1984 Miyazaki was working for different animation studios. He directed several films and gained necessary experience. During this time, he created his famous manga, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. The manga ran from February 1982 to March 1994 and consisted of seven volumes of 1060 pages totally. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia-toned ink. In 1984 this manga was adapted for the screen, leading to the great success. This is usually seen as a pivotal point of Miyazaki career. When working on "Nausicaä" adaptation, Miyazaki started his lasting successful cooperation with music creator Joe Hisaishi.</p>
		<p class="p1">In June 1985 Miyazaki and three his partners founded the animation production company Studio Ghibli. The first film of the studio became the highest-grossing animation film of the year in Japan. The second film, My neighbor Tottoro, was commercially unsuccessful, but was acclaimed by critics and later became a cult classic. In 1992, with the outbreak of Yugoslav war, Miyazaki directed Porco Rosso, more "adult" anti-war film, that remained the highest-grossing animated film in Japan for several years.</p>
		<p class="p1">The two decades of 1990s and 2000s can probably be considered the Golden Era of Miyazaki animation. In this period he combined hand-drawing with computer graphics. In 1994-1997 his film Princess Mononoke became the first animated film to win the Picture of the Year Award in Japan. His next work, Spirited Away, won the Academy Award (i.e. Oscar) for Best Animated Feature. So, in these two decades Miyazaki became a world celebrity. His animation acquired wide acknowledgement over the world, not only Japan.</p>
		<p class="p1">As for personal life, Miyazaki married his fellow animator Akemi Ota in 1965. They have two sons: Goro and Keisuke. His elder son, Goro, is also an animator. In 2006 he directed Tales from Earthsea, an animated film inspired by both Ursula K.Le Guin Earthsea series and Hayao Miyazaki's manga Shuna's Journey. The film was commercially successful and got wide public acknowledgement. However, both Ursula Le Guin and Hayao Miyazaki were not satisfied with the plot. Currently, Goro Miyazaki is the curator of the Studio Gibli Museum.
