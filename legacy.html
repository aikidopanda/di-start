			<p class="p3">Miyazaki's views and creative style were influenced by both Japanese and Western authors. In different periods he cited as inspiration Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, Ursula K.Le Guin and some other writers. He was also influenced by Soviet animation, particularly by Yury Norstein. Even in the modern era of computer graphics, significant part of his films remained hand-drawn. He is known for his attention to details, since he oversees every frame of his works.</p>
			<p class="p3">Japanese animator is known for his distinct creative pattern. In his works he constantly returns to a set of themes, that were important for him during his whole career. Among these themes are pacifism, enviromentalism, love and family. Miyazaki is also well known for the absence of totally unsympathetic antagonists in his works. His complex narratives does not intend to personify the good and evil, as fantasy and animation jenre usually did. Instead of it, he depicts the Buddhist nature of evil:greed, ill will, and delusion.</p>
			<p class="p3">Miyazaki is often described as a feminist author. He describes his female characters as "brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart". Concerning the portrayal of female protagonist, his Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, created in 1984, can be considered a revolutionary animated film. Some of his works, particularly "The Wind Rises", reflect Miyazaki's memories about his mother, who were closest to him and influenced his later work</p>
			<p class="p3">In 2016 BBC called Miyazaki "the godfather of animation in Japan". Along with Walt Disney, he is considered to be one of the greatest animators in world history. His outstanding role into development of animation is recognized by most reputable modern studios, such as Pixar, Aardman Studios and Disney Animation Studios.However, his cultural impact is not limited to multiplication. Many famous film makers acknowledged Miyazaki's works as a source of inspiration. Among them were Wes Anderson, James Cameron, Guillermo del Toro, Steven Spielberg and many others. Sometimes Miyazaki is cited as inspiration by videogames creators. Today we can easily say that Miyazaki's name is written in golden letters in the history not only of animation, but of the whole cinematograph.</p>
